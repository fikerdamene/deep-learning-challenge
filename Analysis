Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to build and evaluate a deep learning model to predict the success of charitable donations. The model aims to classify whether a donation request will be successful based on various features extracted from the dataset. By preprocessing the data, training a neural network, and evaluating its performance, we aim to identify patterns that can help improve the success rate of donation requests.

Data Preprocessing

Target Variable:

IS_SUCCESSFUL: This is the binary target variable indicating whether a donation request was successful (1) or not (0).

Feature Variables:

APPLICATION_TYPE

AFFILIATION

CLASSIFICATION

USE_CASE

ORGANIZATION

STATUS

INCOME_AMT

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS

ASK_AMT

Variables Removed:

EIN: This is an identifier and does not contribute to the predictive modeling.

NAME: This is also an identifier and is not useful for prediction.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:

Input Layer: The number of neurons is equal to the number of input features (44 in this case after one-hot encoding and scaling).

First Hidden Layer: 80 neurons with ReLU activation function. Chosen to capture complex patterns in the data.

Second Hidden Layer: 30 neurons with ReLU activation function. Provides additional depth to capture non-linear relationships.

Output Layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

Model Performance:

Initial accuracy achieved: ~74.2%

Steps Taken to Improve Model Performance:

Data Preprocessing: Handled categorical variables by grouping less frequent categories into 'Other' and used one-hot encoding.

Feature Scaling: StandardScaler was used to normalize the input features.

Model Architecture Tuning: Experimented with the number of neurons and layers.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusted the number of epochs for training.

Summary

Overall Results:

The deep learning model achieved an accuracy of approximately 74.2%. Although this is a decent starting point, there is room for improvement.

Recommendations for Different Models:

Random Forest Classifier: Given the categorical nature and the possible non-linear relationships in the data, a Random Forest could potentially provide better performance through ensemble learning.

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): GBM can handle the imbalanced nature of the data well and might provide better accuracy and precision.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): With the right kernel, SVMs can be powerful for binary classification problems with clear margins of separation.

Why These Recommendations:

Random Forests are robust to overfitting, especially with a large number of trees, and can handle categorical variables effectively.

GBM offers better handling of class imbalance and can capture complex interactions between features.

SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and can provide a clear margin of separation for classification tasks.

In conclusion, while the neural network provides a good baseline, experimenting with different models like Random Forests, GBM, and SVM could yield better predictive performance for the classification problem.
